# HeartRatePhoneApp
This is a simple App I used to communicate with a hardware heart rate monitoring via bluetooth.
This App uses the CoreBluetooth Framework as well as iOS Charts to read bluetooth characteristics 
interface them with the user. 
This is my first ever Swift App with simple and commented code so that it could be used in the future
by graduate students of Miami University to build bluetooth integrated Apps for targetting iOS.
